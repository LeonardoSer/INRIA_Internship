# Evolution of Social Graphs Over Time - INRIA Internship

Welcome to my repository for the "Evolution of Social Graphs Over Time" project, conducted during my internship and projet de fin d’étude (PFE) at INRIA, Nice (FR), within the COATI team. This project explores the dynamic nature of social networks through the lens of scale-free networks, focusing on the evolution of collaboration networks among French computer science researchers.
Motivations

Networks represent a fundamental structure in both natural and human-made systems, such as the World Wide Web, social networks, and scientific collaboration networks. These systems, characterized by their scale-free nature, follow a power law distribution with exponential cut-off, indicating that nodes preferentially attach to others with a high degree of connections. Understanding these networks' evolution over time offers insights into the underlying self-organizing phenomena that govern large network development.

## Challenges

The primary dataset for this project includes collaboration data from 258,145 French computer science authors from 1990 to 2018, detailing their publications and co-authorships. The challenges faced in this work include:

- Ensuring data accuracy and managing outliers to prevent skewed analyses.
- Overcoming the lack of detailed temporal data, with only the year of collaboration available for analysis.
- Developing robust metrics to analyze vertex trajectories within the network, where a vertex trajectory represents the evolution of an author's collaborations over time.

## Goals

The project aimed to:

- Familiarize with the collected data by constructing the underlying collaboration network.
- Investigate the network's mathematical properties and their evolution, focusing on vertex trajectories and degree distribution.
- Develop a mathematical model capable of generating similar graphs to understand and predict the evolution of such networks.

## Outcomes

This internship resulted in a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of social graphs, particularly focusing on scientific collaboration networks. The findings contribute to our understanding of how individual nodes' degrees evolve over time within scale-free networks.
