# Projet de Fin d'Étude (PFE) at INRIA COATI Team

Welcome to the repository for my Projet de Fin d'Étude (PFE) conducted at INRIA, Nice, France, within the COATI team. This project explores the fascinating domain of social graphs and their evolution over time, under the supervision of esteemed professors Małgorzata Sulkowska, Nicolas Nisse, and Frédéric Giroire.
Project Overview

The focus of this project was to delve into the dynamics of social graphs, which represent the intricate web of relationships and interactions within various social networks. By studying these graphs, we aimed to uncover patterns and principles governing their evolution over time, contributing valuable insights into the field of network science and its applications.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this PFE were to:

- Understand the underlying structure and dynamics of social graphs.
- Analyze the evolution of these graphs over time, identifying key patterns and trends.
- Develop and apply mathematical models to predict future evolution patterns of social networks.

## Contributions

This project contributes to the broader field of network science by providing:

- A detailed analysis of social graph evolution.
- Insights into the mechanisms driving changes in social networks.
- Mathematical models capable of simulating and predicting the behavior of social graphs over time.
